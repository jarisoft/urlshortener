# urlshortener
Implementation of a url shortening service . 

This project was build using MVC pattern and uses some other design patterns such observer pattern. 

# What it does
This service provides the opportunity to create shorter URLs by a given url.
You can look up a url and see if it is already used as target url or as short url. 

The front-end is very simple. It uses bootstrap and jquery. The focus was more on the back-end side. 

Currently the service is hosted under http://local.jarisoft.eu/ for demonstration purposes 
but will be removed from there within the next few days.
